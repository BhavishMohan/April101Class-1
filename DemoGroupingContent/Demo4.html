    The leaves are alternately arranged simple ovals 5 to 12 cm long and 3–6
    centimetres (1.2–2.4 in) broad on a 2 to 5 centimetres (0.79 to 2.0 in) petiole
    with anacute tip, serrated margin and a slightly downy underside. Blossoms are
    produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves.
    The flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five petaled,
    and 2.5 to 3.5 centimetres (0.98 to 1.4 in) in diameter.
    The fruit matures in autumn, and is typically 5 to 9 centimetres (
    2.0 to 3.5 in) in diameter.
    The center of the fruit contains five carpels arranged in a five-point star,
    each carpel containing one to three seeds, called pips.</blockquote>
